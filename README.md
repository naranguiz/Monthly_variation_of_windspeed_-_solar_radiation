# Monthly_variation_of_windspeed_and_solar_radiation

Python code processes and displays wind and solar energy data. It loads data from CSV files, organizes it into annual and monthly data frames, and then generates graphs showing the monthly variation of wind speed, depending on its height, and solar radiation for specific years (for Isla Mocha, Chile).

Solar and wind data were obtained through:
